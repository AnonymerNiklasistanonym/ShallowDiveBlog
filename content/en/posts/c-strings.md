## Basics

The C programming language has a set of functions implementing operations on strings (character/byte strings) in its standard library:

{{< include_code file="static/code/c_strings/demo.c" lang="c" >}}

{{< include_code file="static/code/c_strings/demo.log" lang="text" >}}

While other languages like Java store the length of an array C does not do it.
It instead has the convention to **null-terminate** every `char[]`/string instead:

- a string of $n$ characters is represented as an array of $n + 1$ elements
- the last of which is a "`NULL` character" with numeric value 0

Meaning the line `char str1[] = "Hello"` actually stores 6 `char`s where the last one is `NULL`:

{{< include_code file="static/code/c_strings/null_termination.c" lang="c" >}}

{{< include_code file="static/code/c_strings/null_termination.log" lang="text" >}}

## Hardware

- the smallest addressable memory unit in most hardware nowadays is a byte $=8$ bits
  - each bit can store $2$ states: $1$/$0$
  - $n$ bits can store $2^n$ possible combinations (e.g. $2$ bits: $2^2 = 4$ [`00`, `01`, `10`, `11`])
- 32-bit, 64-bit, ... refer to CPU architectures (and corresponding operating systems)
  - Registers **INSIDE** CPUs are used to hold immediate data:
    - instructions
    - memory addresses
    - data for calculations
  - A $n$-bit CPU has $n$-bit wide registers (e.g. $64$-bit CPU has $64$ bit $= 8$ byte wide registers)
    - This length is often called the natural unit of data a CPU processes at a time: a `word` / `size_t`
      - Linux: `unsigned long`
      - Windows: `SIZE_T`
  - Since memory access instructions (e.g. Assembly `mov`/`load`/`store`) of the CPU ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) are hard-coded to use a register as memory address
    - a $32$ bit CPU can address a theoretic maximum of $2^{32}$ byte $\approx 4$ gigabytes
    - a $64$ bit CPU can address a theoretic maximum of $2^{64}$ byte $\approx 18$ exabytes ($= 18000$ terrabytes)

### Hardware Implementation C Strings

- on a hardware level all characters are stored as consecutive fixed width unsigned binary integers that each represent a code unit
  - terminated by an additional zero code unit

- when speaking of *strings* normally code units of type `char`/`wchar_t` are meant

  - a `char` is $8$ bits $=1$ byte (on most modern machines)
  - a `wchar_t` is $16/32$ bits  $=$ $2/4$ byte

## Character encoding

To consistently map (encode) binary numbers represent by bits also known as code points to characters/symbols there are multiple standards:

### ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

In 1963 the ASCII character encoding defined $2^7=128$ symbols consisting of $33$ unprintable symbols and $95$ printable characters.

- Inspired by type/telewriter layout
  - A-Z, a-z, 0-9, punctuation marks
  - the ordering of characters, such as the uppercase letters preceding lowercase ones
  - control characters like
    - Carriage Return (`CR`) and Line Feed (`LF`) $\Rightarrow$ Creates new line by moving the *printer* back to first column and to the next line

  - ![1963 Teletype Model 33 input (https://kbd.news/Teletype-Model-33-1274.html)](../../images/c_strings/teletype-model-33-top.jpg)

They are represented by numbers from $[0,127]$:

```

The reason the symbols are encoded as $7$-bit values was intentional because early computers handled data in bytes which are blocks of 8 bits.
The extra, eighth bit was originally reserved for error checking.

#### ASCII Extensions

This was enough for basic English use but was extended by various countries internationally to $8$-bit values ($2^8=256$ meaning $128$ custom symbols) to support their symbols/punctuation/...

- e.g. ISO/IEC 8859 which contains `ä`, `ü`, `ö`, `ß`, `€`, `Ä`, ...

### Unicode

To solve the problem of multiple character encoding standards (that are different depending on the current locale) Unicode is one table that contains all of them instead of having to switch the encoding depending on the current use case.

Designed in 1988 by Joe Becker at Xerox this standard (where the first $256$ code points mirror the ISO/IEC 8859-1 standard) extends the code points to $16$ bits ($2^{16}=65536$) which should allow to universally encode all modern/future text with one standard: https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/.

This was later extended to $32$ bits for supplementary characters in Unicode 3.0 (1999) and nowadays contains even a lot of emotes.

#### UTF (Unicode Transformation Format)

If you would store each character as $32$ bits this would waste for most characters in English/Latin $2/3$ of $4$ empty bytes.

To support all current Unicode code points but still keep the storage size small a transfer function is used that widens the amount of bytes depending on how big the code point of a single symbol is (variable length characters):

- UTF-8 uses $1$ to $4$ byte per code point (indicated by a bit mask)

  - Maximal compatibility with ASCII since the first $128$ symbol have the same code points

  - | First code point | Last code point    | Byte 1     | Byte 2     | Byte 3     | Byte 4     |
    | ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
    | U+0000 (0)       | U+007F (127)       | `0yyyzzzz` |            |            |            |
    | U+0080 (128)     | U+07FF (2047)      | `110xxxyy` | `10yyzzzz` |            |            |
    | U+0800 (2048)    | U+FFFF (65535)     | `1110wwww` | `10xxxxyy` | `10yyzzzz` |            |
    | U+010000 (65536) | U+10FFFF (1114111) | `11110uvv` | `10vvwwww` | `10xxxxyy` | `10yyzzzz` |

    - If the first bit in a byte is $0$ it's a $1$ byte wide wide symbol

    - If the first bits in a byte are $110$ it's a $2$ byte wide wide symbol

    - ...

    - e.g. `ä` has the Unicode code point `U+00E4` (228, `1110 0100`):

      ```text
      // UTF-8 encoding pattern for 2-byte characters:
         110x xxxx   10xx xxxx
      // Filling in the bits of 00E4:
      // -> 0000 0000 1110 0100
      //
      //    0 0011     10 0100
      // 110         10
         1100 0011   1010 0100
      ```

- UTF-16 uses $2$ or $4$ byte per code point (indicated by a high surrogate)

  - Used by the Windows API and by many programming environments such as Java and Qt
  - If the first 2 bytes are between U+D800 ($55296$) and U+DFFF ($57343$) this indicates a surrogate pair meaning this code point is combined by this and the next $2$ bytes

- UTF-32 uses a fixed width $4$ byte code point

  - No transfer necessary since every Unicode character fits into $32$ bit

> Using a variable length encoding like UTF-8 breaks existing code for string length and other operations when counting the actual code points!
>
> The bigger size or e.g. resolving the actual encoded symbols with multiple bytes needs to be explicitly counted!
